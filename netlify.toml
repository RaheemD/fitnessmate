# netlify.toml - place at repo root (replace your current netlify.toml)

[build]
  # If you use a specific publish directory change the line below.
  # Typical Netlify static site uses the repo root or 'dist' or 'public'.
  # Example (uncomment & edit if needed):
  # publish = "public"

# --- Redirect .well-known requests to the folder you actually uploaded (well-known) ---
# This lets Android and verification tools request /.well-known/assetlinks.json
# while your repo contains the non-hidden folder /well-known/assetlinks.json
[[redirects]]
  from = "/.well-known/*"
  to = "/well-known/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

# --- OPTIONAL: safe catch-all for a single asset (if you only need this file) ---
#[[redirects]]
#  from = "/.well-known/assetlinks.json"
#  to = "/well-known/assetlinks.json"
#  status = 200
#  force = true

# --- IMPORTANT: remove any redirect entries that use /.netlify/... as the `from` path ---
# Netlify does not allow "from" paths that begin with "/.netlify".
# If you previously had something like:
# from = "/.netlify/functions/myapi"
# remove it or change it to a proper public path (e.g. "/api/*" -> "/.netlify/functions/:splat")
#
# Example of correct proxying to functions (ONLY if you actually use Netlify Functions):
# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/api/*"
#   to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
#   status = 200
#   force = false
#
# But you said you no longer use Netlify functions, so do NOT add the .netlify path here.
