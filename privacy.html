  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="box">
    <h2>Local Storage & Minimal Cloud Sync</h2>
    <p>By default, your data is stored locally on your device. When you sign in, FitnessMate uses Supabase to securely sync a minimal set of data required for core functionality (such as your profile, goals, and workout history). We do not sell or share your data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your information remains on your device and, if signed in, is transmitted securely over HTTPS and stored in Supabase with access limited to your account. We only retain the minimum data necessary to operate the app.</p>

    <h2>Data Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control of your data. Clearing your browser data removes local information. If signed in, you may stop syncing by signing out and request deletion of synced data associated with your account at any time.</p>

    <h2>AI Interactions</h2>
    <p>AI coaching features may send anonymized queries to external services for workout guidance, but no personal information is retained or shared.</p>

    <h2>Image Processing</h2>
    <p>Images (for example, food or workout snapshots) are processed temporarily and never stored permanently.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdSense to serve relevant ads. Google and its partners may use cookies and similar technologies to personalize and measure ad performance based on your prior visits or app activity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can opt out of personalized ads in <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a>.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, opt out of third‑party vendors' personalized advertising at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aboutads.info</a> or <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optout.networkadvertising.org</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Regional Consent</h2>
    <p>Where required by local law (for example, in the EEA/UK), we display a consent prompt to manage choices for cookies and personalized advertising.</p>

    <h2>Effective Date</h2>
    <p>This policy is effective as of <strong>October 19, 2025</strong> and may be updated from time to time. Substantial changes will be reflected on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For privacy questions or requests, please use the in‑app Support form (Profile → Account → Support). We will respond as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>Terms of Service (Summary)</h2>
    <p>By using FitnessMate you agree to use the app for personal, lawful purposes and to our limitations of liability. FitnessMate is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. Fitness and nutrition guidance is informational only and not a substitute for professional medical advice. We may update or discontinue features at any time.</p>
